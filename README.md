Personal-Website
================

This is where I'm going to be developing my own personal website. Won't publish to the net till it's done. Probably just use it temporarily as my github page.

This mostly going to just be worked on as a hobby. Won't be focusing on developing it so activity here may be lax.

I've got a few goals with this website, they may change as I develop this further.

Goals include:
1) That it function as a resume.
2) A place to link all my projects. Both hobby and professional.
3) Be pretty and functional as the fan in my room.
4) For it to be a project I can always work on.

I'll edit as I think of new goals or feel like removing old ones.
